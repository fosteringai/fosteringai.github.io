We will increasingly be supported by and interact with technology that is powered by Artificial Intelligence. This calls for an education that prepares us for this future.\nFAIaS intends to hone the skills, both hard cognitive and soft skills, required to understand, build or interact with Artificial Intelligence. We thus consider AI, not in the narrow, purely technological sense, but in the broad sense, as it impacts many different parts of our lives. We, therefore, choose decisively for an interdisciplinary and inclusive approach that focuses not only on STEM activities but involves all school subjects and covers a broad range of aspects, including the ethical, philosophical, economic, legal, and historical. We believe that approaching a subject matter from different perspectives deepens the understanding, and creates cohesion between the learners in an intrinsically interdisciplinary field like Artificial Intelligence.\nOBJECTIVES\nFAIaS’s ultimate goal is to improve the knowledge of artificial intelligence on children and youngsters. We break down this goal into the following high-level objectives:\n Improve high school students understanding of AI technologies and their impact. Provide teachers across subjects with online and offline tools \u0026amp; guidelines that can be readily integrated into their courses. Improve the knowledge of minorities and underprivileged groups in society specifically, through non-formal education.

And, we will increasingly be supported by and interact with technology that is powered by Artificial Intelligence. It is important to realize that not only technical careers will be impacted by this evolution, but almost every profession, ranging from historians, marketeers, healthcare workers to teachers will be changing. Every day, new AI platforms are being developed to support students and teachers tasks, but we are so busy with our daily tasks that we do not have time, or do not make time free to learn about those new trends. That is why the Erasmus+ project FAIaS (Fostering AI at Schools) has been launched, to bridge that knowledge gap and make it easy for the educational sector (schools, teachers, students and policy makers) to understand AI. The goal of FAIaS is to create easy content for teachers and students to learn about AI: learn what it is, where it is implemented, how to use it, how to create it, and also understand the positive and negative ways in which AI can impact our lives.\nFormat: On-site event\nSpeakers:   Gregorio Robles, Coordinating partner of FAIaS \u0026amp; Full Professor at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos.

It is sometimes called the science of decision making and it is the driving force behind autonomous vehicles. In essence a self-driving car learns how to drive on its own by trial and error using feedback following its own actions, just like we humans learn how to ride a bike. In this workshop we will take away some of the mystery behind the technique and also learn a task ourselves using Reinforcement Learning.\nWorkshop 2 - Discovering our unconscious bias\nWho: Liliana Carrillo, CollectiveUP\nDescription: Our experiences, and who we are, shape the way we see the world and these influence the decisions we make. Each person has a somewhat different view of the world, and each person has some tendencies, inclinations or prejudice towards/against something or someone, and that is called bias. We are all (unconsciously) biased! Some biases are positive and helpful as they keep us safe, but some others are based on stereotypes and can lead us to discriminatory practices. No worries! we are here to learn. This workshop explains what implicit bias is, why we are biased, how it is different from overt bias, how to recognize our own bias, and get some tips to overcome your bias.\nWorkshop 3 - LearningML\nWho: Luisa Yánez, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos\nDescription: LearningML is a web platform aimed at using supervised machine learning, one of the most successful AI techniques that is at the base of almost all current AI applications, in education. It has been designed with a low-floor idea, that allows users to use it even with minor knowledge of computers and AI, in general. It offers the possibility to classify texts, images and sounds. And for the most advanced users, you can integrate the machine learning models they create into their Scratch programs easily.\nWorkshop 4 - Moral Machine\nWho: Antonio J. Romero Universidad Rey Juan Carlos Madrid\nDescription: Moral Machine is an online platform, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that generates moral dilemmas and collects information on the decisions that people make between two destructive outcomes. The presented scenarios are often variations of the trolley problem, and the information collected would be used for further research regarding the decisions that machine intelligence must make in the future. For example, as artificial intelligence plays an increasingly significant role in autonomous driving technology, research projects like Moral Machine help to find solutions for challenging life-and-death decisions that will face self-driving vehicles.\n📬 Subscribe to our newsletter Sing up to receive more information about FAIaS project via email, and you’ll be the first to know about Artificial Intelligence and more.

In 2018, VUB ranked #47 in Reuters’ Most Innovative Universities Top 100 in Europe, it has 127 active patent families and disclosed 40 inventions. VUB counts more than 3300 employees (47% female), of which \u0026gt;2200 academic staff.\nVUB accommodates 3 doctoral schools (Human Sciences, Natural Sciences and (Bioscience) Engineering, and Life Sciences and Medicine) that cater to the needs of its more than 1,600 PhD students (2017: 1,677). Additionally, the university provides high-quality education in all academic fields to more than 16,000 BA and MA students (2017: 16,094). VUB is an active participant in European R\u0026amp;I projects, Horizon 2020 in particular. There are currently about 120 running R\u0026amp;I projects at VUB in all strategic research clusters, and the budget acquired from European funding sources doubled from €6 million to €14 million between 2014 and 2018. The increase mainly demonstrates VUB’s commitment to promoting European R\u0026amp;I, as well as its internationally renowned position as centre of knowledge in the capital of Europe.\nVUB’s Artificial Intelligence Lab was founded in 1983 by Luc Steels and was the first AI Lab in Europe. Under the leadership of Prof. Ann Nowé, it counts 60 researchers including 11 professors. Since its creation, the AI Lab has successfully delivered more than 50 doctoral dissertations of which 13 in the last 5 years. The lab has a publication record of more than 850 publications at major conferences such as ICML, IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI, SAT, CP, and high impact journals such as AIJ, JMLR, JAAMAS, ACM TOCL, TPLP. Throughout our history, we have built an extended international AI network, for example through membership and participation in CLAIRE, EurAI, AI4EU among many others. It has a solid track record in fundamental as well as applied research, both on the European level (7 EU projects in the last 5 years) and the national level.\nRecently, the lab opened its AI Experience Center, a high-tech test, demonstration and meeting environment where companies, tech entrepreneurs, researchers, policy makers and the general public can experiment with AI and collaborate to develop and produce technological solutions.
