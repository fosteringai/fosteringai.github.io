## INTERNATIONAL HAPPY HOUR!

This 24th of October between 18.00h-19.00h CEST, will take take place the first streaming 'Happy Hour' in english! Some of the educators that follows the project speaks other languages different of spanish, so we have decided to stream a special edition of Happy Hour with International experts in english.

What is Happy Hour? The Happy Hour is a live event where you will have the opportunity to interact in a dynamic and fun way with the different speakers and guests. Various topics on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are covered in short sections of about 5 minutes each.
