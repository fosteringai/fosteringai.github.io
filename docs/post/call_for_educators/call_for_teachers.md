## About the FAIaS Project

FAIaS fosters the knowledge and skills around Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at European schools.

Its goals are: 
- To foster the knowledge and skills around Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning in European schools.
- To achieve goal #1 in a way that is as inclusive as possible, with special attention to gender, economically and socially disadvantaged students, among others. 
- To raise awareness of the technical, social and ethical implications of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

Its expected outcomes are:
- High-quality, open learning materials and experiences for educators and learners on AI and ML.
- Easy-to-use web-based (open source) software tools to support learning of AI and ML.
- Organization of activities for educators and learners on AI and ML (and make our learning materials, experiences and tools known).


## About the LTTA

During the short-term training activity (4 days) organised in Braga in May-June 2022, the 20 FAIaS ambassadors selected by the partners from the participating countries (10 from Belgium, 5 from Spain and 5 from Portugal) will meet the FAIaS consortium and not only will be fully trained on the FAIaS objectives and introduced to the FAIaS outputs, but, most of all, they will be officially designated and invested with their role within the FAIaS project.

To be a FAIaS Ambassador means to be ready, eager and willing to collaborate, contribute, and be committed to the FAIaS project implementation. Each FAIaS Ambassador will be a core figure within the project and the role will consist of and will require to:
- Contribute in the drafting and revision of the main project outputs (collecting also contributions and suggestions from the local teachers)
- Act as a liaison between the FAIaS partners and the FAIaS local teachers communities 
- Train and support the local school teachers and colleagues to actively take part in FAIaS activities
- Encourage teachers to collaborate, to share ideas and projects, to use the FAIaS repository and tools 
- Moderate the FAIaS local community 
- Support with the dissemination of the FAIaS results to the school communities

During the short-term training activity the FAIaS ambassadors will not only be “theoretically” trained on the FAIaS results but will also have the chance to practise with the “Repository of existing AI content and initiatives” (IO2) and the “Peer-to-peer online community” (IO6). Interactive and collaborative sessions will be organised in order to share experience and proposals between the FAIaS Ambassadors and foster a strong collaboration among them.
In order words, the added value of LTTA consists in the official launch of the FAIaS peer-to-peer online community, which will be animated by the trained FAIaS ambassadors, and in the official publication of the FAIaS repository, ready to be used, benefited and exploited by the wider FAIaS community


## About the Ambassadors

Candidates can be educational experts/leaders, teachers, headmasters and other decision makers at schools, education professionals, educational policy makers, educational researchers, PhD students, executives from the educational industry and other volunteers that can prove a strong connection with schools and matured previous experience within the educational world.

Being part/member of educational networks (at regional, national or european level, i.e eTwinning, EUN etc) and /or having taken part in other innovative educational initiatives is considered a plus. B2 English is a must.

It is not compulsory to have a sound knowledge on AI, since the FAIaS proposal welcomes and supports those teachers who can be considered “beginners”, in order to unhinge the stereotype for which only STEM teachers can use artificial intelligence in their classrooms.

Each partner will organise a kick-off meeting with their regional Ambassadors in order to (better) explain their role within the project, to introduce the FAIaS objectives and results, to present the main project activities and outputs. 


## About Braga

[**Braga**](https://www.cm-braga.pt/en) is a city and a municipality capital of the northwestern Portuguese district of Braga and of the historical and cultural Minho Province. It is the third-largest urban centre in Portugal (after Lisbon and Porto). It is host to the oldest Portuguese archdiocese, the Archdiocese of Braga of the Catholic Church and it is the seat of the Primacy of the Spains. Under the Roman Empire, then known as Bracara Augusta, the settlement was the capital of the province of Gallaecia. Inside of the city there is also a castle tower that can be visited. Nowadays, Braga is a major hub for inland Northern Portugal and it is an important stop on the Portuguese Way path of the Road of St James. The city was also the European Youth Capital in 2012.
The easiest way to go to Braga by plane is to fly to [**Oporto international airport (OPO)**](https://www.aeroportoporto.pt/en/opo/home), and then catch a train or a bus to Braga. Braga is about one hour from [**Oporto**](https://www.cm-porto.pt/) by bus or direct train.
