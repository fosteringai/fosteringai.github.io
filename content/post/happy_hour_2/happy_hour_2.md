## HAPPY HOUR #2!

We are delighted to announce that the second Happy Hour will take place at the end of February!

The Happy Hour is a live event where you will have the opportunity to interact in a dynamic and fun way with the different speakers and guests. Various topics on Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning are covered in short sections of about 5 minutes each. 

You can watch our first Happy Hour [**here!**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dNqTIVoByWM)
To be able to participate you only need to register in our Eventbrite event, and one day before the Happy Hour, you will receive an email with the password to access the streaming on the BigBlueButton platform.

If you have any questions about the registration process or access to the platform, you can contact us at faias@fosteringai.net.

The programme with all the sections of this second edition will be announced later, so we invite you to follow us on our social networks and subscribe to our newsletter:
