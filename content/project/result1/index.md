This intellectual output, devoted to secondary teachers, will be an easy-and-ready to-use handbook that will:
- Introduce teachers (especially those who are without experience and/or are skeptical on the use of AI in humanistic topics) into the AI word.
- Showcase appealing and inspiring examples and resources of how to use A.I. in the classroom covering different topics, and ranging from science to math, from literature to philosophy.
