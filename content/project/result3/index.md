LearningML aims to be a free/open-source web-based platform aimed to bring Machine Learning (ML) fundamentals in a practical way to children or people interested in the growing field of AI. 

This tool provides a platform intended to build ML models from example data, and a Programming Platform allowing to code creative applications using those models. At this point, LearningML is a proof of concept to explore whether machine learning algorithms can be executed locally in the browser in order to avoid the use of an AI cloud service when designing a tool to learn ML. The development has taken place under the umbrella of INTEF (the Spanish National Institute for Educational Technologies and Teacher Training), being its main developer a member doing his Ph.D. part-time at URJC. We aim to further develop LearningML so that it becomes a comprehensive free/open-source tool for learning AI at schools in Europe.
