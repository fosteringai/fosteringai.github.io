We will increasingly be supported by and interact with technology that is powered by Artificial Intelligence. This calls for an education that prepares us for this future.\nFAIaS intends to hone the skills, both hard cognitive and soft skills, required to understand, build or interact with Artificial Intelligence. We thus consider AI, not in the narrow, purely technological sense, but in the broad sense, as it impacts many different parts of our lives. We, therefore, choose decisively for an interdisciplinary and inclusive approach that focuses not only on STEM activities but involves all school subjects and covers a broad range of aspects, including the ethical, philosophical, economic, legal, and historical. We believe that approaching a subject matter from different perspectives deepens the understanding, and creates cohesion between the learners in an intrinsically interdisciplinary field like Artificial Intelligence.\nOBJECTIVES\nFAIaS’s ultimate goal is to improve the knowledge of artificial intelligence on children and youngsters. We break down this goal into the following high-level objectives:\n Improve high school students understanding of AI technologies and their impact. Provide teachers across subjects with online and offline tools \u0026amp; guidelines that can be readily integrated into their courses. Improve the knowledge of minorities and underprivileged groups in society specifically, through non-formal education.

With this in mind, the TCB team has been dedicated to listening to teachers and their concerns, suggestions, and questions. Whether through focus groups, questionnaires or informal conversations, our team has been dedicated to understanding, in close touch with the teacher´s community , ways to design and bring the content closer to their real needs.\nThe data collected so far allow us to integrate some lessons in the material we are developing and also serve those who are developing similar projects in this area.\nHere are some of the things we have learned so far, in five key points:\nSimple, Validated and Trusted All the feedback we have gathered from the teachers are all basically in the same direction: the content should be simple, validated, and reliable.\nTeachers want to feel comfortable and safe (scientifically and pedagogically) about the content they share in the classroom, so there is no space for mistakes or unvalidated content. It is essential to have good, accessible and reliable sources when creating content for sharing in the classroom. The world is already full of counter-information and fake news. The classroom should be a space of truth, and teachers want to feel (and own) that trust.\nFocus on the learning goals The learning goals are one of the most fundamental parts of a lesson plan. Therefore, they should be objective, clear, and achievable.\nWhen we do not have clear learning goals, we may lose the message along the way. So, it is fundamental to start with the question: what do we want students to learn from this? And that question should be the beacon when creating this type of content.\nFreedom to the teachers Generally speaking, teachers like to receive information and educational resources that are useful for their classes. However, they should have the freedom to choose how to incorporate this content into their classroom, i.e., they want to approach the content in the way that makes the most sense to them and for their students.\nMake it official The content must be related to the official national programme that the teachers must abide by. Schools have a predefined national curriculum that they must follow. Often, these curriculums are demanding and do not leave much room for improvisation. Therefore, it is fundamental to relate the content created to the official education programmes. That will facilitate and enable the relationship between projects and formal education and therefore its adoption.\nGive context and keep it interesting Finally, it is also fundamental to consider the context. These ideas that we have been sharing are directly related to Portuguese teachers, specifically from the schools of Braga. Meaning that maybe some of these contributions might make less sense when speaking about teachers from another part of the world. Therefore, it is important to consider the territory and the profile of students in which we find ourselves in and where we want to adopt and implement these contents and lessons. Also, motivation plays a key role. Teachers want to have content that speaks closely to the students' everyday life. Matters that motivate them and keep them engaged in the conversation. Being aware of what inspires the youth these days is half a step towards achieving that motivation and their engagement.\nThese five key ideas will surely guide our upcoming prototypes and tests. Also, this close and trustwordly relation with the teachers community is essential to ensure we deliver a project that is adequate to their actual needs and makes them trust us and embrace the project with us. Although these conclusions may seem straightforward they are extremely relevant to the success of the project and guarantee that the results will be adopted and implemented over the next few years.\nIf you are a teacher and want to contribute to this conversation or participate in the project, you can contact us through fosteringai@gmail.com. We would be happy to hear your contributions!\n📬 Subscribe to our newsletter Sing up to receive more information about FAIaS project via email, and you’ll be the first to know about Artificial Intelligence and more.

The digital tool is called LearningML and it uses the interface of Scratch to make it easy to use and playful for the new generations. The idea behind the creation of this digital tool is to integrate it in teaching practices to complement the experience and help deepen the understanding of Machine Learning in a playful way.\nThe FAIaS consortium thinks that the use of LearningML (and other easy-to-use accessible tools based on Machine Learning) in the classroom offers an opportunity to contribute to the advancement of digital skills in Europe and it also can support updating the educational system. Students will be provided with new and innovative ways to expand the content taught in the classroom in the different subjects and offer alternative ways to understand concepts.\nFor inspiration, the lessons of taxonomy in biology courses can include AI concepts:\n  For example, students can learn about AI while actually learning about flower classification, without coding, and only by using the AI-tool Giotto. Francesco Palma and Isaac Rosat have written a ‘Step by step flower classification’ article about it and a video tutorial too.\n  There are other apps based on AI that help scientist to classify plant species and there is a huge branch of research, and innovation around biodiversity that is uses related concepts and for some inspiration we invite you to read the science article about ‘Artificial intelligence could help biologists classify the world\u0026rsquo;s tiny creatures: Automation could aid biodiversity monitoring’\n  The what and technicalities about LearningML Now, going back to the topic of the LearningML tool of this FAIaS project, the team has opted for using and collaborate with an Open-Source tool. While the whole team is constantly doing user testing and giving new ideas for the improvement of the tool, we are very grateful to professor Juan David Rodriguez who has been coding most of the tool.\n    Users can access the tool at: https://learningml.org/ LearningML uses the Scratch interface LearningML is open source and other people can help to develop it further. Visit the GitLab project There is a developer guide that can help others to develop the tool further There is a blog with news about the tool, available in English LearningML uses Tensorflow javascript libraries to build the machine learning model LearningML has two development versions:  A stable version that users can use with confidence as this is a development in an advanced state, that is a fully functional and bugs-free version. A beta version that has more features than the stable version but is in a development and testing phase, and some functionalities may have some errors.    Below, you find a list with some of the differences between the two available versions:\nStable version 1.2:\n Functionalities:  Texts Images   Languages:  Spanish English German Greek Galician Catalan    Beta version 1.3:\n Functionalities:  Texts Images Numbers   Languages:  Spanish English German Greek Galician Catalan Portuguese    The how to use LearningML in the classroom Learning materials Throughout the implementation of LearningML in the lessons to use in the classroom and to use in non-formal inclusive settings , the FAIaS consortium is and will be creating materials about the LearningML tool to facilitate its learning.\nLearningML is an easy tool to implement in classrooms, with a fluid and very intuitive interface. We have made a series of video tutorials about LearningML that you can see below:\n Introduction to the web interface \u0026amp; sign up process Demo exercise of basic image recognition Demo exercise of basic text recognition  We have also included more complete official video tutorials that you can find in the official website.\nAlso, lesson plans will be published for easy use in the several lessons. Meanwhile, we invite you to see the complementary work developed in the UK on the topic of machine learning for kids and a video about machine learning with Scratch\nEvents and workshops Through the realization of events and workshops we have already taught several teachers how the platform works and taught different examples of the activities that can be performed with it, such as the classification of historical architectural styles or the classification of verbal forms. Among its basic functionalities, it is also worth highlighting the possibility of creating one\u0026rsquo;s own application through the Scratch block programming language, which makes programming accessible to any user who does not have a previous knowledge base.\nComplementary work about digital tools    In addition, we have also raised the importance of transmitting values and education based on critical thinking with other platforms related to Artificial Intelligence such as the MIT web tool of Moral Machine. Knowing how to interpret and evaluate certain events is vital for correct decision making. The Moral Machine puts us in the extreme situation of the decision making that an autonomous car must make when it is involved in an accident penalizing passengers or pedestrians. With the different cases it presents us with, it opens up certain kinds of debates about whether the user would be willing to buy a car that in a certain circumstance can make decisions that may harm him or whether the common benefit is more important than the individual one. You can read more about LearningML and the Moral Machine tools and workshops in our previous post about the Multiplier Event held in the city of Braga (Portugal) last November.\nInvitation to the Happy Hour    Finally, we want to let you know that every 3 months we organize live interactive sessions online with the name of Happy Hour. We invite you to attend the happy hour to learn about new tools, connect with teachers, hear about their experiences, connect with AI professionals, and learn in an informal and relaxed way.

This Impact Gathering attracted a diverse public ranging from teachers to policy makers, with the slogan: “For a better understanding of what Artificial Intelligence is and how it can be used (or misused) in education and training”.\nThis event had two parts: in the morning there were engaging talks at the main conference room, and in the afternoon practical workshops.\nThe first part in the morning started with a Keynote from Paulo Novais with the title of \u0026ldquo;Artificial Intelligence and Educational Challenges: Fundamental Concepts, Present and Future Applications”. Paulo Novais explained how humans had always worried about transmitting knowledge to the future generations. And he showed how technological evolution can help us to solve that problem and other social and economical problems. He explained how AI has been integrated in our life and how it has progressed till the point of creating artwork today.\nPaulo\u0026rsquo;s speech showed examples of the use of emerging technologies at schools: robots in the classroom, use of sensors and cameras to monitor some behaviors, virtual reality… and he inspired the public to take advantage of the use of AI tools and smart classroom resources to enhance the learning for each student.\n   After Paulo Novais, the next speaker Gregorio Robles explained the main objectives of the Erasmus+ project FAIaS (Fostering Artificial Intelligence at schools) and its ultimate goal: inspire teachers to learn about AI, make it accessible to them and facilitate the work of teaching AI in any subject, not only in the most technical or mathematical subjects. This translates into 3 concrete project results with guidelines, lesson plans and an easy to use machine learning tool integrated into the lessons.\n   The next talks in the morning were in the form of a panel, a debate about \u0026ldquo;An Artificial Intelligence centered on trust”. For this occasion, the speakers were Maria Manuel Leitão Marques (Member of the European Parliament and Member of the Special Committee on Artificial Intelligence in the Digital Age AIDA), Vitor Carvalho (Professor and Researcher at IPCA \u0026amp; Member of the Commission\u0026rsquo;s Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence and Data in Education and Training at the European Commission), Liliana Carrillo (Founding Director of CollectiveUP, co-founder of the European Digital Development Alliance and co-founder of Shine Your Light) and Joana Miranda (Executive Director of Braga, Unesco Creative City in Media Arts).\nThe panelists talked about some of their worries and wishes about the use of AI:\n The use of data in AI-based tools, citizens’ rights, data privacy and the use of data. The challenges about bias in AI. The importance of having good datasets for creating good AI models. And the use of AI for the benefit and support of the community.     It was of particular interest to hear about the human-centered and society-centered approach to AI at technology that all the panelists had. The FAIAS partners are pleased with the support from EU Parliamentarian Maria Manuel Leitão Marques and her support on Twitter\n\nJust after the panel, the morning program was closed by Ricardo Rio, Braga’s Mayor, who also counted with the virtual attendance of EU Parliamentarian Maria.A networking lunch followed his closing words.\n      In the afternoon, the second part of the event started with four workshops related to AI topics. The first workshop was carried out by Marjon Blondeel and had as title \u0026ldquo;In a Reinforcement Learning agent\u0026rsquo;s shoes\u0026rdquo; . This workshop was very popular among teachers from Braga city schools, and many attended it and learned about the Reinforcement Learning technique and some of the mysteries behind it.\n   The second workshop was \u0026ldquo;Discovering our unconscious bias\u0026rdquo; carried out by Liliana Carrillo and many teachers learned about the biases that each person has about different topics. Teachers were invited to participate in several activities that helped them realize their unconscious biases and invited them to become more conscious about it.\n   The third workshop was “LearningML tool” given by Luisa Yánez. In this workshop, she showed to teachers how easy it is to create text and image classification models in the LearningML tool and its use to activate students' critical thinking. This LearningML tool is an open-source web application created to facilitate the learning and teaching of Machine Learning.\n   The fourth workshop was the “Moral Machine” given by Antonio José Romero. The Moral Machine is a web tool created by MIT to pose dilemmas about decision-making of autonomous devices in extreme situations. In this workshop, the importance of pondering about certain circumstances and implementing critical thinking based lessons was emphasized.\n   Acknowledgements: FAIAS partners thank everyone who cooperated in any way to the successful organization of this event.

It is important to realize that not only technical careers will be impacted by this evolution, but almost every profession, ranging from historians, marketeers, healthcare workers to teachers will be changing. Every day, new AI platforms are being developed to support students and teachers tasks, but we are so busy with our daily tasks that we do not have time, or do not make time free to learn about those new trends. That is why the Erasmus+ project FAIaS (Fostering AI at Schools) has been launched, to bridge that knowledge gap and make it easy for the educational sector (schools, teachers, students and policy makers) to understand AI. The goal of FAIaS is to create easy content for teachers and students to learn about AI: learn what it is, where it is implemented, how to use it, how to create it, and also understand the positive and negative ways in which AI can impact our lives.\nRegistration form To attend the event and workshops, register here\nFormat: On-site event\nSpeakers:   Gregorio Robles, Coordinating partner of FAIaS \u0026amp; Full Professor at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos.

It is sometimes called the science of decision making and it is the driving force behind autonomous vehicles. In essence a self-driving car learns how to drive on its own by trial and error using feedback following its own actions, just like we humans learn how to ride a bike. In this workshop we will take away some of the mystery behind the technique and also learn a task ourselves using Reinforcement Learning.\nWorkshop 2 - Discovering our unconscious bias\nWho: Liliana Carrillo, CollectiveUP\nDescription: Our experiences, and who we are, shape the way we see the world and these influence the decisions we make. Each person has a somewhat different view of the world, and each person has some tendencies, inclinations or prejudice towards/against something or someone, and that is called bias. We are all (unconsciously) biased! Some biases are positive and helpful as they keep us safe, but some others are based on stereotypes and can lead us to discriminatory practices. No worries! we are here to learn. This workshop explains what implicit bias is, why we are biased, how it is different from overt bias, how to recognize our own bias, and get some tips to overcome your bias.\nWorkshop 3 - LearningML\nWho: Luisa Yánez, Universidad Rey Juan Carlos\nDescription: LearningML is a web platform aimed at using supervised machine learning, one of the most successful AI techniques that is at the base of almost all current AI applications, in education. It has been designed with a low-floor idea, that allows users to use it even with minor knowledge of computers and AI, in general. It offers the possibility to classify texts, images and sounds. And for the most advanced users, you can integrate the machine learning models they create into their Scratch programs easily.\nWorkshop 4 - Moral Machine\nWho: Antonio J. Romero Universidad Rey Juan Carlos Madrid\nDescription: Moral Machine is an online platform, developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, that generates moral dilemmas and collects information on the decisions that people make between two destructive outcomes. The presented scenarios are often variations of the trolley problem, and the information collected would be used for further research regarding the decisions that machine intelligence must make in the future. For example, as artificial intelligence plays an increasingly significant role in autonomous driving technology, research projects like Moral Machine help to find solutions for challenging life-and-death decisions that will face self-driving vehicles.\n📬 Subscribe to our newsletter Sing up to receive more information about FAIaS project via email, and you’ll be the first to know about Artificial Intelligence and more.
