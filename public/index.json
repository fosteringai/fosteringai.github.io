We will increasingly be supported by and interact with technology that is powered by Artificial Intelligence. This calls for an education that prepares us for this future.\nFAIaS intends to hone the skills, both hard cognitive and soft skills, required to understand, build or interact with Artificial Intelligence. We thus consider AI, not in the narrow, purely technological sense, but in the broad sense, as it impacts many different parts of our lives. We, therefore, choose decisively for an interdisciplinary and inclusive approach that focuses not only on STEM activities but involves all school subjects and covers a broad range of aspects, including the ethical, philosophical, economic, legal, and historical. We believe that approaching a subject matter from different perspectives deepens the understanding, and creates cohesion between the learners in an intrinsically interdisciplinary field like Artificial Intelligence.\nOBJECTIVES\nFAIaS’s ultimate goal is to improve the knowledge of artificial intelligence on children and youngsters. We break down this goal into the following high-level objectives:\n Improve high school students understanding of AI technologies and their impact. Provide teachers across subjects with online and offline tools \u0026amp; guidelines that can be readily integrated into their courses. Improve the knowledge of minorities and underprivileged groups in society specifically, through non-formal education.

In 2018, VUB ranked #47 in Reuters’ Most Innovative Universities Top 100 in Europe, it has 127 active patent families and disclosed 40 inventions. VUB counts more than 3300 employees (47% female), of which \u0026gt;2200 academic staff.\nVUB accommodates 3 doctoral schools (Human Sciences, Natural Sciences and (Bioscience) Engineering, and Life Sciences and Medicine) that cater to the needs of its more than 1,600 PhD students (2017: 1,677). Additionally, the university provides high-quality education in all academic fields to more than 16,000 BA and MA students (2017: 16,094). VUB is an active participant in European R\u0026amp;I projects, Horizon 2020 in particular. There are currently about 120 running R\u0026amp;I projects at VUB in all strategic research clusters, and the budget acquired from European funding sources doubled from €6 million to €14 million between 2014 and 2018. The increase mainly demonstrates VUB’s commitment to promoting European R\u0026amp;I, as well as its internationally renowned position as centre of knowledge in the capital of Europe.\nVUB’s Artificial Intelligence Lab was founded in 1983 by Luc Steels and was the first AI Lab in Europe. Under the leadership of Prof. Ann Nowé, it counts 60 researchers including 11 professors. Since its creation, the AI Lab has successfully delivered more than 50 doctoral dissertations of which 13 in the last 5 years. The lab has a publication record of more than 850 publications at major conferences such as ICML, IJCAI, AAAI, ECAI, SAT, CP, and high impact journals such as AIJ, JMLR, JAAMAS, ACM TOCL, TPLP. Throughout our history, we have built an extended international AI network, for example through membership and participation in CLAIRE, EurAI, AI4EU among many others. It has a solid track record in fundamental as well as applied research, both on the European level (7 EU projects in the last 5 years) and the national level.\nRecently, the lab opened its AI Experience Center, a high-tech test, demonstration and meeting environment where companies, tech entrepreneurs, researchers, policy makers and the general public can experiment with AI and collaborate to develop and produce technological solutions.

You can enable this feature by toggling the highlight option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\n```python import pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head() ```  renders as\nimport pandas as pd data = pd.read_csv(\u0026quot;data.csv\u0026quot;) data.head()  Charts Academic supports the popular Plotly chart format.\nSave your Plotly JSON in your page folder, for example chart.json, and then add the {{\u0026lt; chart data=\u0026quot;chart\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} shortcode where you would like the chart to appear.\nDemo:\n  (function() { let a = setInterval( function() { if ( typeof window.Plotly === 'undefined' ) { return; } clearInterval( a ); Plotly.d3.json(\"./line-chart.json\", function(chart) { Plotly.plot('chart-537491682', chart.data, chart.layout, {responsive: true}); }); }, 500 ); })();  You might also find the Plotly JSON Editor useful.\nMath Academic supports a Markdown extension for $\\LaTeX$ math. You can enable this feature by toggling the math option in your config/_default/params.toml file.\nTo render inline or block math, wrap your LaTeX math with $...$ or $$...$$, respectively.\nExample math block:\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |} {\\left \\|\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right \\|^2}$$  renders as\n$$\\gamma_{n} = \\frac{ \\left | \\left (\\mathbf x_{n} - \\mathbf x_{n-1} \\right )^T \\left [\\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n}) - \\nabla F (\\mathbf x_{n-1}) \\right ] \\right |}{\\left |\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n}) - \\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n-1}) \\right |^2}$$\nExample inline math $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$ renders as $\\nabla F(\\mathbf{x}_{n})$.\nExample multi-line math using the \\\\\\\\ math linebreak:\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\\\\ 1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$  renders as\n$$f(k;p_{0}^{*}) = \\begin{cases}p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=1, \\\\\n1-p_{0}^{*} \u0026amp; \\text{if }k=0.\\end{cases}$$\nDiagrams Academic supports a Markdown extension for diagrams. You can enable this feature by toggling the diagram option in your config/_default/params.toml file or by adding diagram: true to your page front matter.\nAn example flowchart:\n```mermaid graph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2] ```  renders as\ngraph TD A[Hard] --\u0026gt;|Text| B(Round) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result 1] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result 2]  An example sequence diagram:\n```mermaid sequenceDiagram Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts!

By wrapping a paragraph in {{% callout note %}} ... {{% /callout %}}, it will render as an aside.\n{{% callout note %}} A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers. {{% /callout %}}  renders as\n A Markdown aside is useful for displaying notices, hints, or definitions to your readers.
